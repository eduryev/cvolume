cvolume
=======

``cvolume`` is a `SageMath <https://www.sagemath.org>`_ module to compute completed
and Masur-Veech volumes of strata of quadratic differentials with odd zeros.
You can install it on top of a SageMath installation on your computer (see the instructions
below). 

``cvolume`` is based on `SageMath <https://www.sagemath.org>`_ module 
_`admcycles <https://gitlab.com/jo314schmitt/admcycles>`
to compute intersection numbers on moduli spae of complex curves.

# EXAMPLES

Example:
   ```sage: print('Hello')
   Hello```

And other stuff.
